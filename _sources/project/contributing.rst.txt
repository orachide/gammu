Contributing
============

We welcome contribution in any area, if you don't have developer skills, you
can always contribute to :doc:`localization` or just `donate us money`_. In case you are
interested in fixing some code, please read :doc:`../internal/index` to
understand structure of Gammu code. We also maintain list of
`wanted skills <https://wammu.eu/contribute/wanted/>`_ where you can find in
which areas we currently mostly lack manpower.



Creating Pull Requests
----------------------

The Gammu project is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/gammu>`_ which uses
`Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ as version control system in the Background.

So start with forking & cloning our Git repository::

    git clone https://github.com/gammu/gammu.git gammu

Once you have done that, do some fixes and commit them (see
`Git tutorial <https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html>`_
